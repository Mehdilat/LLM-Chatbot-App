# Mehdi-Bot: LLM Chatbot Application

Due to the constraints of monthly subscriptions, users are often limited to a specific AI model, which can restrict flexibility and adaptability in various applications. Currently, there are no solutions that offer simultaneous access to both OpenAI and Anthropic models on a pay-per-use basis. Mehdi-Bot aims to bridge this gap by providing users the option to interact with multiple AI models through a single, cohesive interface.

Mehdi-Bot is a conversational AI application built using Streamlit, OpenAI, and Anthropic APIs. The bot is designed to interact with users through a chat interface, providing responses based on the selected AI model. Users can choose between OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet models for generating intelligent and context-aware replies.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive chat interface powered by Streamlit.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple AI models for diverse response styles and capabilities.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Get instant responses as you chat with the bot.
- **Easy Deployment**: The application is containerized using Docker, making it easy to run and deploy.
